Overview
It's essential to ensure that the required CSV files (users.csv, records1.csv, records2.csv, 
records3.csv, and players.csv) are located in the same directory as the main Python script. 
This setup is necessary for the correct functioning of the script.

Prerequisites
Python: The script requires Python to be installed on your system. If you don't have Python installed, download and install it from python.org.

pygame: pip install pygame
openCV: pip install opencv-python

CSV Files: Ensure that the CSV files (users.csv, records1.csv, records2.csv, records3.csv, and players.csv) are placed in the same directory as the main Python script.

Execution Instructions
Windows
Open Command Prompt: Press Win + R, type cmd, and press Enter.

Navigate to the Script Directory: Use the cd command to change to the directory containing your script.

Example:

cd path\to\your\script
Replace path\to\your\script with the actual path to your Python script.

Run the Script: Execute the script by typing:


python main.py


Linux

cd /path/to/your/script
Replace /path/to/your/script with the actual path.

Run the Script: Execute the script by typing:

python3 main.py
or

./main.py
(Make sure your script has execution permissions. You can set it with chmod +x main.py.)

macOS
Open Terminal: You can find it in Applications -> Utilities, or use Spotlight to search for it.
